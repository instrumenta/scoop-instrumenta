Installing the bucket will provide access to Instrumenta software via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```console
scoop bucket add instrumenta https://github.com/instrumenta/scoop-instrumenta
```

Installing individual software tools can then be done as follows:

```console
scoop install kubeval
scoop install conftest
```
